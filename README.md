## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
  Octavia 
   -Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings  "mean". Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
  
  Amanda
   -Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.
   -Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer    them
  
  Sadia
   -Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
   -Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.
